name: SmartReadNote
description: |
  Use this function to have a separate LLM read a note from the vault and return
  relevant content to you based on the 'prompt' you provide. The idea is that you won't need to
  overload your context with a lot of potentially irrelevant content if you only need something
  specific about a given note.
params:
  note_name:
    type: string
    description: |
      The name of the note to read, written in the same way as notes are referenced
      in the vault. For example, to read the ./AGENTS.md file, use note_name='AGENTS'; to read the note in
      './0 Daily/2025-10-11.md', use note_name='2025-10-11'.
  prompt:
    type: string
    description: |
      The prompt passed to the LLM that will read the note. This prompt indicates
      what it should return to you. For example, 'Does this note mention X?' or 'Does the note contain
      benchmark results for Y? If so, output them.'
